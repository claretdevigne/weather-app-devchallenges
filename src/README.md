# Weather App

## DESCRIPTION
This is a simple weather app build with React. It's use to show the knowledge in React, creating the Frontend of pages and the use of API's.
Originally, I was going to utilize [meta weather api](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) but it doesn't work anymore. So I had to got the data from the API [Open meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), which doesn't have features like humidity, visibility and air pressure.

## HOW IT WORKS
In the main windows it appears:
- Image reference of the weather.
- Temperature in ÂºC
- Weather Name
- Date
- Location

The second window shows six boxes, one for every day, showing:
- Date
- Image reference
- Max temperature and min temperature

the third window contains four boxes showing:
1.- Wind Status (wind speed and wind direction)
2.- Humidity (Percentage).
3.- Visibility.
4.- Air pressure. It doesn't work by restrictions from the api provider.

Clicking in the "Search for places" button you can open the menu and select a city. For now, you only
can select between "Cancun, Mexico" and "Mexico city, Mexico". No more cities were added cuz it's something easy to do and this is not the goal of the creations of this weather app.
